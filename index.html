    I am currently working as a software engineer at PCMS in Cincinnati, OH.

<p>
    I recently completed my second year of graduate school in the University of Kentucky's Computer Science department in May 2019,
    earning a Master of Science in Computer Science. My time in graduate school included working on a project focusing on story
    generation through machine learning, specifically with a sequence-to-sequnce network and hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder.

    In the past, during graduate school, I have graded for the Intro to Operating Systems course at UK, tutored Computer Science
    subjects through Tau Beta Pi, and worked as a web developer at Valvoline.

    Between undergrad and grad school, I worked in software engineering, test automation, and performance engineering over 
    several projects at Tata Consultancy Services in Cincinnati, OH.
