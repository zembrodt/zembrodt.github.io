<p>I am currently in my second year of graduate school in the University of Kentucky's Computer Science department.</p>
<p>This semester I am working on a project focusing on story generation through machine learning, specifically sequence-to-sequnce networks. Other classes I am taking are Advanced Software Engineering and Large Scale Data Science. I am also tutoring Computer Science through Tau Beta Pi.</p>
<p>In the past, during graduate school, I have graded for the Intro to Operating Systems course at UK and worked as a web developer at Valvoline here in Lexington, KY.</p>
<p>Between undergrad and grad school, I worked in software engineering, test automation, and performance engineering over several projects at Tata Consultancy Services in Cincinnati, OH.</p>
