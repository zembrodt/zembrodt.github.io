<h2>Projects</h2>
<strong>Spring 2016:</strong>
<p>I am currently working on a machine learning senior design project. Project github can be found <a href="https://github.com/cafe-predicting">here</a> and the project webpage at <a href="http://cafe-predicting.github.io/">http://cafe-predicting.github.io/</a>.</p>
<strong>Fall 2015:</strong>
<p>Worked with different algorithms for an Artificial Intelligence class. Highlight was creating an AI to traverse a game's maze in order to find a key for a locked door (if needed) and the sword to kill the boss.</p>
<p>Worked with several C-based projects for a systems programming class with Linux. Developed a basic shell to execute programs with in/out streams and handle the loading and execution of user pluggins.</p>
<strong>Summer 2015:</strong>
<p>Studied abroad in Germany. No projects.</p>
<strong>Spring 2015:</strong>
<p>I was working on a couple personal projects having to do with 2D Game development with C++.
I've uploaded some somewhat recent code for one of them, although nowhere near complete, and it can be
viewed on my Github <a href="https://github.com/zembrodt/simple-game-engine">here</a>.</p>
<p>I created a store catalog site using PHP and MySQL for my databases class. I plan on uploading the project to Github once I clean up the code.</p>
