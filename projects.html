<h2>Django Home <small>(name TBD)</small></h2>
<p>
    In the process of learning the Django framework and also launching a web application to production.<br/>
    This project allows users to create an account to create their own "Dashboards". A "Dashboard" is composed of modules
    the user selects and modifies the settings of.<br/>
    Currently available modules include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Datetime</li>
    <li>Forecast</li>
    <li>Photos</li>
    <li>Weather</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The user can add and remove modules from their dashboard, and can update their positions on the screen with drag-and-drop
    functionality, or buttons to update their z-index. The goal is when viewing their dashboard, a user can fullscreen the webpage
    (F11 in Google Chrome, for instance) and let the page sit on the screen. This can be used on a non-primary display (such as
    an unused monitor, tablet, or television) with images and information displayed that the user customized.<br/>
    Future updates include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Better dashboard editing functionality</li>
    <li>More modules, such as Twitter or news feeds, traffic updates, etc</li>
    <li>Multiple dashboards per user, useful for different displays</li>
    <li>Ability to share dashboards with other users</li>
    <li>Stock or user-uploaded public images other users can choose from instead of only their own images</li>
    <li>Save module positions relative to the current screen rather than their exact top/left css values</li>
</ul>

<h2>Story Generation <small>(Master's Project)</small></h2>
<p>
    Project began as an independent study with Dr. Brent Harrison at UK during my Fall 2018 semester. Goal is to generate
    sentences using a sequence-to-sequence network. The project for this independent study can be found at
    <a href="https://github.com/zembrodt/story-generation">story-generation</a>.<br/>
    The independent study's final report can be found <a href="assets/docs/cs612-final-report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Currently this semester I am continuing this project for my Master's project by using a hierarchical recurrent
    encoder-decoder. <br/>
    The project for this can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zembrodt/hred-story-generation">hred-story-generation</a>.
    A current draft of its final report can be found <a href="assets/docs/cs610-final-report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Jenkins Test Selection Plugin</h2>
<p>
    Worked on a software engineering group project for class that selects test cases after Jenkins builds.<br/>
    Project was developed using Java as a plugin for Jenkins and used 3rd party tools including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Last+Changes+Plugin">Jenkins Last Changes Plugin</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://javaparser.org/">JavaParser</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/thombergs/diffparser">Diffparser</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-invoker/">Apache Maven Invoker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The plugin's code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cs685-2018/test-selection">github.com/cs685-2018/test-selection</a>,
    and the project's main repository is at <a href="https://github.com/cs685-2018">github.com/cs685-2018</a>.

<h2>Large Scale Sentence Pre-processing</h2>
<p>
    Worked on a data science group project for class to pre-process large amounts of natural language text with Hadoop MapReduce
    using Python scripts. The project's goal was to process a large amount of the NL text into in-order sentences as they are
    found within their respective texts. Use case for this project is to pre-process data that is then meant to be used for other
    projects such as machine learning.<br/>
    The project's repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cs626-2018/sentence-preprocessing">github.com/cs626-2018/sentence-preprocessing</a>.</p>

<h2>PyMETEOR</h2>
<p>
    Developed a Python implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEOR">METEOR</a> for the story-generation project.<br/>
    Its repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/zembrodt/pymeteor">PyMETEOR</a>.

<p>
    Developed a chat app in Go for my programming languages course at UK.<br/>
